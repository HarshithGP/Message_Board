# Message_Board 
Full Stack Message Board web application with Token Authentication

Developed a full stack web application in Angular and Node to implement the functionality of a message board. 
The application allows new users to register, existing users to log in / log out and update their profile using reactive-based forms in angular 2 validated by built in and custom designed validators. 

Enhanced the user interface using a combination of angular’s materials library and bootstrap for styling.

Functionality 
1. New user registration
2. Existing User Log in / Log out 
3. Existing user profile update
4. Post messages on a dashboard
5. Filter messages based on username

Architecture
The node backend functions as the message board web API and permits registered users to post new messages that are stored in the server’s memory for future retrieval. The API serves the messages stored on the server and the angular application is used to create the components and services that make requests to the back end to either post or retrieve messages. User registration and login is implemented through token authentication and validation. The full stack application is developed using Angular, Typescript, Node JS and the express framework.
